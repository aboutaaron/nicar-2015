__Ferguson__
News organization covered a lot. 
- NYT
- BuzzFeed

School wanted to do a more comprehensive look. Stats include
- Law enforcement
- Economic
- Education 
- Segregation

Tried to get data at the city level (Schools have good data)
Looked at 22 cities in MO. Looked for
- Cities of >10,000
- @ least 10% Black population

For law enforcementL
- Adult and juv arrest rate disparities
  - Compared arrest rates 18+, <18 with 2010 Census data
- Traffic stop disparities (allegedly easy)
  - Most states (Atto. Gen) have data
- Warrants per 10,000 population
  - Warrants earn cities $$$
  - Went to state board to get warrant rates

For Economics
- poverty disparity
- unemployment disparity

For Segregation
Herzog says this analysis was more groundbreaking
- Something like 12 different measures of segregation
- Ended up talking to Douglas Massy (sp)
  - Socialogist at prinction who writes about segregation in US
- Looked at black-white dissimilarity
- isolation (interactivity)
- interaction
- delta (geographic size of census tract)
- Theil''s entropy
- Measures of exposure
- Census bureau has great data on housing patterns
