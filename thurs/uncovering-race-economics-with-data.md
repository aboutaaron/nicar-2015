News organization covered a lot. 
- NYT
- BuzzFeed

School wanted to do a more comprehensive look. Stats include
- Law enforcement
- Economic
- Education 
- Segregation

Tried to get data at the city level (Schools have good data)
Looked at 22 cities in MO. Looked for
- Cities of >10,000
- @ least 10% Black population

For law enforcementL
- Adult and juv arrest rate disparities
  - Compared arrest rates 18+, <18 with 2010 Census data
- Traffic stop disparities (allegedly easy)
  - Most states (Atto. Gen) have data
- Warrants per 10,000 population
  - Warrants earn cities $$$
  - Went to state board to get warrant rates

For Economics
- poverty disparity
- unemployment disparity

For Segregation
Herzog says this analysis was more groundbreaking
- Something like 12 different measures of segregation
- Ended up talking to Douglas Massy (sp)
  - Socialogist at prinction who writes about segregation in US
- Looked at black-white dissimilarity
- isolation (interactivity)
- interaction
- delta (geographic size of census tract)
- Theil''s entropy
- Measures of exposure
- Census bureau has great data on housing patterns

Segregation was not always a problem
ProPublica tested theories, using census data to see how race/class influece segregation. Found that even affluent Black and Latino families did not live in wealthy, white neighborhoods.

How do you show trends instead of independent of samples? Research. Took Hananh-Jones and 3+ researchers six months to write a graf to explain.

Many of hannah-jones stories were testing theories on the racial political history in the US: desegregation orders, school redistricting, gerrymandering

Majority of data came from census data, state dept. county and shapefiles from county GIS departments

Data is just the beginning
- Find it
- Analyze it
- Interogate it

SOMEONE IS MAKING DECISIONS THAT IS MAKING THIS HAPPENING

## Tim Henderson
You can get section 8 tract from Census data. Also, talk to HUD

Compare section 8 tract location against racial census tract data
